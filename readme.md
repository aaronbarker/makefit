# makeFit
Mainly getting this into a stash repo for easy sharing.  This is currently maintained as part of the LDS.org project, and so this will likely fall behind our version until we are able to make this part of our daily process. Hey, at least I'm up front about it :)

## Requirements
This is a jQuery UI Widget Factory based plugin, and so will need [ui.widget.js](http://dev.ldscdn.org/scripts/ui/1.9.1/jquery.ui.widget.min.js) to function.
